# Blood Donation

Demo of a blood donation app that connects donors and recipients.

## Setup
This app uses firebase as a backend. In order to run it, you need to add your own google services files
in the following locations:
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
